# covers-ps1
A collection of "clean", uniform covers of PlayStation games, for use with PS Classic or
emulator frontends.

After expanding the game library of the Sony PlayStation Classic I wanted a selection of
covers that would fit alongside the existing bundled games, and found that because of
differences in the size and shape of PS1 game boxes across regions and years it wasn't
easy to find an existing collection I could use.

So I made my own. Sometimes I could just use an existing scan of a case cover or manual,
but usually I would have to edit out imperfections or unwanted design elements, or
come up with an entirely new composition using other key art for the game.

Covers are included only for the games I was personally interested in. As such, this is
not a complete collection of covers.

# Copyright stuff

Obviously I don't own any of the original game artwork or original iconography included
here. I put these compositions together for my own amusement, but the game artwork and any
logos etc. all belong to their original creators.
